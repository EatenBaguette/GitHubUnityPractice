# GitHub and Unity Practice
 A repository for practicing sharing a Unity project using a git repository.

## Documentation
During the initial commit, I added the README.md file, and more importantly, used the .gitignore file recommended by [this](https://dcardonab.notion.site/Git-GitHub-Resources-cc92ced4ae554fea9530398e28275d4c) website.

When I was creating the boolean flag field, I was accidentally putting it in the Start() method. I realized my mistake and moved it above that method. Afterwards, I had no further issues.
